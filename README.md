# Database Programming Project

- This project uses MySQL and IntelliJ IDEA to create a development environment that acts as straight communication 
median between the user and the database. Using a free third-party plugin that is available in the IntelliJ plugin
marketplace. Database Navigator allows the user to connect to their local MySQL instance and through MySQL script,
the user can create tables, edit those values, and delete values. The project could act as template if changes want
to be made for any database interactions. 

## Installing and running application 

- 1: Start by cloning this repo straight from Github and creating a new project from VCS. Or download the project
  and extract the zip and continue normally to starting a new project in IntelliJ IDEA. 
- 2: Download the plugin 'Database Navigator' to establish the connection to MySQL workbench. After creating your
  database in MySQL, you can continue to IDEA. 
- 3: After making the correct jdbc pathway link to your database, your connection can be made.
- 4: This can also be used as a template if decided, but after downloading the MySQL Connector/J 8.2.0 and implementing
  this in your project's pathway; the project should be ready to be run.
- 5: It is to be mentioned that the connector/J download process will be made through selecting the 'Platform Independent'
